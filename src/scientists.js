Albert Einstein was best known for his General and Special theory of relativity and the concept of mass-energy equivalence which is best known from the equation E = mc2.",

By studying the spectra of various stars, one can find their temperature and from that, using Saha’s equation, determine the ionisation state of the various elements making up the star.
