Sir M V suggested that India try to be at par with industrialized nations as he believed that India can become developed through industries. He has the credit of inventing ‘automatic sluice gates’ and ‘block irrigation system’ which are still considered to be marvels in engineering. Each year, his birthday 15 September is celebrated as Engineer’s Day in India. Since river beds were costly, he came up with an efficient way of filtering water through ‘Collector Wells’ in 1895 which was rarely seen anywhere in the world.\",\n    img:\n      \"https://thebetterindia-english.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2014/05/sirmv_MV.jpg\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: 21,\n    name: \"V.

Bose adapted a lecture at the University of Dhaka on the theory of radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe into a short article called “Planck’s Law and the Hypothesis of Light Quanta” and sent it to Albert Einstein. Einstein agreed with him, translated Bose’s paper “Planck’s Law and Hypothesis of Light Quanta” into German, and had it published in Zeitschrift für Physik under Bose’s name, in 1924.

By studying the spectra of various stars, one can find their temperature and from that, using Saha’s equation, determine the ionisation state of the various elements making up the star.

He was the first person to use semiconductor junctions to detect radio signals, thus demonstrating wireless communication for the first time.
